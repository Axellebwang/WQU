## How to Run This Project

1. **Set up a Python environment (Python 3.8 or later recommended).**

2. **(Optional but recommended)** Create a virtual environment:
   In the project directory, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

    python -m venv venv

To activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:

      source venv/bin/activate

- On Windows:

      venv\Scripts\activate
  
3. **Run the project**
   Launch the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook MSCFE690_GPN9179_M7_CODE_JUPYTER.ipynb
   Make sure the file `price_data.xlsx` is in the same folder as the notebook.
   This notebook uses data from `price_data.xlsx` during execution, so ensure it is present and correctly formatted before running the code.
